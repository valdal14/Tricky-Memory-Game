# Tricky Memory Game

This is another version of the well-known **Concentration** game, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs. It is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Concentration can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows and can be employed as an educational game. [source](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)>)

#### Rules

On each turn, a player turns over two cards (one at a time) and keeps them if they match numbers. If they successfully match a pair of numbers.

When a player turns over two cards that do not match numbers, those cards are turned face down again and it becomes the next turn.

If the player click on the card with value 0 the game is over.

When all the pairs have been found, the player wins.
